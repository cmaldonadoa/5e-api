Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, {@i Fraz-Urb'luu's Staff}. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the {@i Tome of Zyx}, the work that served as the foundation for the {@i Demonomicon}. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu instantly knows."

The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.",
